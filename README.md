## How It Works

This modpack automatically keeps its dependencies updated using a GitHub Actions workflow:
- Every day, it checks for newer versions of included mods.
- If any mod has a new version, the `manifest.json` file is updated.
- If a mod is missing, an issue is created automatically to track it.
