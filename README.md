# My REPO Modpack

Welcome to **My REPO Modpack** â€” a curated collection of mods bundled together to enhance your experience with the game **REPO**!

---

## What's inside?
- Carefully selected mods.
- Always up-to-date dependencies.
- Easy installation and compatibility.

This modpack is designed to offer an improved and seamless gameplay experience.

> âš¡ **Dependencies are updated automatically every day!**

## Installation

You can install this modpack directly through the [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager) or any compatible launcher.

Or, manually download it from the Thunderstore page and place it in your modpack folder.

## How It Works

This modpack automatically keeps its dependencies updated using a GitHub Actions workflow:
- Every day, it checks for newer versions of included mods.
- If any mod has a new version, the `manifest.json` file is updated.
- If a mod is missing, an issue is created automatically to track it.
